  description: "We've been waiting for the right month to bring out Maggs Bruchez, the founders of Emby Music and funky house extraordinaires. Their mix of DJing and live performance was a major inspiration to the rest of Philly's live house scene, and they continue to set the example by producing amazing music and running Philly's newest (and perhaps most interesting) funky house label."

  description: "One of Philadelphia's veteran funky house producer/DJs, DEL has been getting dancefloors pregnant since before we were all in diapers. His soulful, groovy track selection is common amongst the end-of-summer rooftop parties that currently dominate our local scene, and his collaborations with Davidson Ospina (as well as his own solo edits of old disco tracks) have earned him acclaim far past the city limits. DEL's DO YOU WANNA BOOGIE? party is a staple of the Winter Music Conference every year, and certainly gets us jealous for not being able to make it down there yet!"

This time, he'll be laying down some sweet, sexy jazz grooves before we get started on our electronic music vibes for the night"

If you've been at practically any burn on the east coast, you have probably heard his music. He's fresh off the release of his latest Integalactic Speakeasy EP, so expect to hear some otherworldly bass."
