  description: "You know how sometimes you listen to that music?
You know the kind... the kind that gets intoxicating, 
makes you feel,
makes you want, 
makes you love...
It gets you going, 
a ring in your ears, 
a sway in your hips, 
...yeah, that music. 


You know that moment when you're dancing
and you take a deep breath 



and everything drops at just the right moment?

Producers of Philadelphia, you now have a new home.
We will gather every fourth Friday."
