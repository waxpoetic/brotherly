The Haunted Woods theme camp will be treating us to their many tricks. Stop by the SpookEasy where it's Halloween all the time.

This is a BYO* party and strictly 21+.

Bring your own fancy cups to stay sustainably swanky. 
A chocolate fountain with fruits and other dip-ables will be supplied for your convenience. 

We value your self expression- 
While we encourage lavish attire, it is up to you what that means."
